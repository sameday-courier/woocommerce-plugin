Sameday Courier shipping method plugin

== Description ==

= Overview =

This plug-in is intended to implement a new shipping method using the Sameday Courier service. As a store owner, after installing the plugin, you are able to import the list of Sameday Courier
service and delivery points assigned to your account. If your customer chooses the order to be delivered with Sameday Courier, you will be able to see this in the list of commands in your store's
administration panel. You will also be able to create an AWB. You can then add a new parcel in the created AWB and show the AWB as a pdf format. If you want, you can show the AWB history or delete the AWB.

For further information, contact us at software[at]sameday.ro !

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* WooCommerce v6.1 or later

= Plugin installation procedure =

* Open your WordPress admin dashboard and go to Plugins/Installed Plugins menu
* Press Add new button and then press Upload Plugin.
* Drag & drop the .zip folder you downloaded and install plugin.

If every thing works, activate plugin and now the new feature are ready to use.

= Setup your Plugin =

1. Go to WooCommerce/Settings and choose SamedayCourier tab.
2. Complete the form and press Save changes. If everything works well you receive a success message.
3. After that, you are able to import the Services and Pick-up point assigned by Sameday to your account. Go to Service and press "Refresh Service". The same for pick-up points importing and (optional) for the locker list.
4. Activate the services by changing the status from "Disabled" to "Always".
5. Add the new SamedayCourier shipping method to your Shipping zones. Go to WooCommerce/Settings menu, open the Shipping zones tab. Choose the shipping zone for which you want to use Sameday services and press "Edit" button then press "Add shipping method" and select "SamedayCourier".

After you have followed all the steps described above, now in the checkout page of your store, your clients are able to see and choose one of the Sameday service.

In the Order page will be displayed a button "Generate awb". After awb is generated you can show it as pdf format. Also, you can show the history of the awb, add a new parcel or simply remove the awb.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This plugin is free to use ? =
Yes! Using this plug-in is free. However, the service offered by our company is based on a contract. The terms and conditions of the contract are negotiated individually.

After signing the contract, the client will receive a set of credentials (username and password). With these credentials, the customer will be able to use the Sameday Courier
delivery service.

= Can I make changes to the plugin's source code ? =

Sure. However, keep in mind that if you make changes to the source code of the plugin you can no longer benefit from the updates we make constantly. Because in a situation like this in case of an update your changes would be overwritten.

NOTE: We encourage customers to fork our GitHub repository and contribute with their ideas
Link to GitHub: https://github.com/sameday-courier/woocommerce-plugin

= Are all easyBox delivery services available ? =

No! For the moment only the service Locker NextDay is available.

= I activated the Locker NextDay service, but I don't see it on the checkout page =

The service is only visible for orders that have a single product in the cart. So make sure you don't have more than one product in your cart.

= I use the estimated cost option but the fixed cost appears on the order page =

This situation may be due to the fact that the name of the locality does not match our nomenclature of localities.
